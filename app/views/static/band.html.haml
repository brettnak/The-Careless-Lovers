    The Careless Lovers

  %p
    The Careless Lovers are an assembly of swing dancer musicians, inspired by the streets and clubs of New Orleans, New York City, and anywhere that hot jazz combos have been laying down swinging rhythms, past and present. The desire of the band is to play a mix of traditional jazz, blues, and swing era tunes and stylings with an attitude that's acoustic, fresh, and dirty. With an infectiously danceable rhythm, the Careless Lovers are bringing the spirit and joy of jazz culture to the streets of Seattle.

  %p
    The Careless Lovers are a party-to-go made up of Seattle's most energetic young musicians, playing brass, reeds, guitar, and upright bass. The Lovers like to sing old-timey melodies and group call and responses that get everyone involved. The band can be found on the streets of Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle, and increasingly in the cozy dance halls, coffee shops, and bars around Seattle.
